# IpGrabber / IpLogger
I've scrive and IpGrabber ( IpLogger ), in PHP language, hidden with an 404 ERROR page ( html/css ).
This script is using [Geoip php extension](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.geoip.php), so active it on your webhost !

## How it works ?
The user just need to go on your page, his ip and a lot of anothers user infos are gonna be scrived into an info.txt
